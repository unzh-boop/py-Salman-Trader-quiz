# Python Salman Trader quiz


Salman Traders wants you to create a simple python program for calculating Total
price and Remaining amount for their customers. The program should start by
reading rate, objects and currency. Then you are also requested to do the following:
• Create a void function that will display “Salman Traders”
• Create a function with return value and with parameters that will compute Total
price as product of objects and rate
• Create a function that will accept the computed Total price as a parameter and will
compute the Remaining amount. If the Total price is more than or equal to
currency, the remaining balance is to be calculated as Currency – Total price,
otherwise print the message ‘Currency not enough’
• Display the output as shown below,

NOTE: The output expected and logic of question differs. So i matched the output of the code.
If you want the code to work as per the requirments then simply change the comaprison operator in the Remaining function from "<=" to ">=".
